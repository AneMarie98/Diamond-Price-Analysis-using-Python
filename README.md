# Diamond Price Analysis using Python
 The price of diamonds varies irrespective of the size because of the factors affecting the price of a diamond. We will use a dataset containing diamond prices based on their features. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. 
 After analyzing the dataset, we will predict diamond prices using the information gained from the diamond price analysis. 
 We will train a machine learning model for the prediction using Python.
